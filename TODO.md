====

Some things I'd like to see in this project, contributions welcome!

* CPAN packaging
* A plugin-style module loader
* A simple way to run just one test
* Benchmark module integration for repeating tests
* Coverage -- an easy way to dynamically enable coverage and get integrated reports w/o
  the coverage wrapper (maybe not a good idea)
* Integration with a cucumber-style file (or directory full of them) that describes each
  test suite and we can cross-reference with tests run to see which are implemented
  and which aren't.

Send patches via github pull requests, and ideas using the github issue tracker.
